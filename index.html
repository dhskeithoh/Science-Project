      <h2 class="pew2"> We are teaching other people how to survive stranded on an island alone. 
         <br> This is what you can do if you want to find water that is drinkable. </h2>
         <ol class="content">
           <li> Find a red cabbage. (A red cabbage is a natural pH indicator and can be used to check the pH of the water) </li>
           <li> Dice up a portion of the red cabbage. (This increases surface area to volume ratio) </li>
           <li> Fil a pot with water and boil it. </li>
           <li> After the water is boiling, pour the diced red cabbage in and boil it. </li>
